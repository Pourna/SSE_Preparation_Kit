/*
* üîç Problem Statement
You are given a row of n houses, each to be painted with one of three colors: red, blue, or green.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is given in a costs matrix:

java

Edit
costs[i][j] = cost of painting house i with color j
where j = 0 (red), 1 (blue), 2 (green).

No two adjacent houses can have the same color.
