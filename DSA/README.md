## What is a Trie?

A trie (also called a prefix tree) is a special type of tree used to store associative data structures, typically strings.

Each node represents a character of a string.

#### Used For:
Efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings, autocomplete, spell-checking.

#### Example - Trie storing "cat", "car", "dog":

````
        (root)
        /   \
       c     d
      /       \
